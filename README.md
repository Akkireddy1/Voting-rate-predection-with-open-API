# Voting-rate-predection-with-open-API
I would like you to create a piece of software that compiles voting participation from 1973 until the latest parliamentary elections. For each year we want to know which election district has the highest number of voters and how much the percentage was (in percentages). The result should contain about the following:
All data needed to resolve the task shall be retrieved by the application from SCB's open
API. Documentation on how this works, you can find here:
• http://www.scb.se/en/About-us/about-the-website-and-terms-of-use/open-data-api/
api-for-the-statistical-database/
• http://www.scb.se/contentassets/79c32c72783a4f67b202ad3189f921b9/apidescription.

The above printout is based on data obtained from the following URL:
• http://api.scb.se/OV0104/v1/doris/sv/ssd/START/ME/ME0104/ME0104D/ME0104T4
Some words on the way ...
• Use any scripting or programming language you want.
• The result may be presented in the terminal / console, on a web site or anywhere else
you find suitable.
• Keep in mind that (hopefully) there will be new elections in the future and that the
election district can be changed by time.
• Prioritise easy-to-read and structured code in front of comments and additional
features.
• It is ok to deliberately omit things that you usually think are important, but then write
something about this.
